# WemosD32pro_EPD_Typewriter
This is a rudimental typewriter using Wemos D32 pro, a Waveshare ePaper 2.9" and a USB host for the keyboard


## Hardware

- Wemos D32 pro (https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d32:d32_pro)
- 296x128, 2.9inch E-Ink display module (https://www.waveshare.com/product/2.9inch-e-paper-module.htm)
- Keyboard USB Host (http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host-keyboard)
- wires, headers and resistances
- microSD


## Software
All the libraries and files included in TYPEWRITER_EPD folder and downloaded from the library manager.

Arduino IDE must be used to upload all these files.

**REMEMBER**

Add the Wemos D32 pro from the Board Manager

### WebServer Rights

All the WebServer functions rights belong to G6EJD (https://github.com/G6EJD), a genius to whom goes my gratitude for the help given to this project.
The functions are an implementation of this library https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/tree/development and of the standard Webserver.h built-in library.
## Still a prototype
