### EPD library Rights

All the EPD functions rights belong to ZinggJM (https://github.com/ZinggJM), a genius whose patience and knowledge has been of incredible help in bringing this project up to light.

The functions are an implementation of this library https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2 and of Adafruit GFX library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library.

### WebServer Rights

All the WebServer functions rights belong to G6EJD (https://github.com/G6EJD), a genius to whom goes my gratitude for the huge help given to this project, follow him here https://www.youtube.com/user/G6EJD, it's worth it.

The functions are an implementation of this library https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/tree/development and of the standard Webserver.h built-in library.

## Still a prototype
This is the actual aspect of the project.

The keyboard will be an assembled mechanical one and the case will be 3d Printed.
To improve the project this could be an idea of the embedded keyboard, inventor 3d model of a custom GH60 keyboard:
